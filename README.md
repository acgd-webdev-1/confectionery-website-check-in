# Confectionery website check-in

## Overview

- Show that you’ve started writing some text.
- Show that you’ve done a few sketches of the layout at different screen sizes and thought about the major chunks of the website.
- Show the progress of your coded prototype.
- There should be significant progress.

*Any 1 of these things would count as a failure:*

- No text
- No sketches
- Nothing started or only started in class
- Only the files are created
- Some HTML but no CSS
